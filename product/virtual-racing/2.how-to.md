## __2__ How it works

### 2.1 Who's the organiser? - You Are!

Anyone can organise a Virtual Race on OpenTrack - 90% of it is just like setting 
up a normal competition.  You, as the organiser, can set the challenge 

- fixed distance run anywhere? 
- fixed course at a time of your own choosing ? 
- combined-events-style fitness challenges?

Our system will find athletes in the same club, and work out all the team scores and category prizes for you.

There are typically three stages to a competition:
 - open up the entries, and take the entry fees if there are any.  
 - during the racing window, people submit their own results, usually from Strava or Garmin (although Youtube may be used for evidence).  Meanwhile, live team scores are building up all the time!
 - you may then have a scrutiny window, when officials look at results, add penalties for short or downhill courses, and teams can review each others' results.

Throughout the whole thing, expect your club's social media channels to come alive like never before!

We guess most people will put on virtual replacements for the existing athletics calendar, but there are no real limits, as long as you are making sure people distance properly and observe local rules!

Just one thing:  we'd prefer a lot of little races than single huge ones - it spreads out the support workload!



### 2.2 Fundraising for Covid-19, and how we handle money.

Athletes are used to paying entry fees, but taking a lot of money to let someone run on their own is frankly implausible (although some competition organisers are trying this!)

Our system can take paid entries in any country where the <a href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a> payment platform is available.  So, why not put on your usual open meeting, set an entry fee or an optional charitable donation, and raise the money for your local COVID-19 appeal fund?  (We'll also set up an account linked to the UK's biggest one to make it easy?)  
To receive money, you need a Stripe account.   

If you are raising money for charity, and we have a national contract, there will be no deductions at all, apart from the credit card fees (typically 1.4% + 20p per payment, the cheapest we know of)



### 2.3 Costs

See our pricing page.

### 2.4 Terms 

Our standard terms for meeting organisers are being re-developed, but our basic principle is this:  we only provide a platform to manage teams and aggregate scores from solo activity.  Athletes are basically training alone, and doing so at their own risk.
