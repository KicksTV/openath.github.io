## __5__ Testimonials and Feedback

Here’s what Sirje Lippe, General Secretary of the Estonian Federation, has to say:

* Federation is more visible
* The number of website visitors has increased
* The work for all involved parties has been simplified – federation people, club managers, coaches, athletes, statisticians etc.
* Licensing insertion and verification is almost gone (before it took 1-2 month..)
* Bibs distribution and preparations for completion is much quicker (before it took 3-4 days, now 3-4 hours)
