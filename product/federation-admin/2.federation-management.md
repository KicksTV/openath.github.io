## __2__ Federation Management

### 2.1 System Roles
The system understands the hierarchy of control and data visibility issues so has various levels of access from federation officers through club officers and down to the athletes themselves.

### 2.2 Multiple Languages
We understand that English is not the first language of Europe and have successfully translated our system into the following languages (and alphabets): Estonian, Belarus, Greek, French and Serbian.

### 2.3 Club Administrators

Each club admin can add new athletes as they come into the sport, see all their members and their current status. They can make or request changes to be made.

#### 2.3.1 Licence Status

The licence status (see last column in the above screen shot) will vary 

Authenticated (logged-in) users will see: 
 
| Status | Icon  |
| ------ | ----- |
|currently active | green tick |
|expired but can renew | paper plane | 
|  |  |

To request a new license the club admin simply clicks on the athlete.

Every night, the federation will get an email alert with the athletes waiting, and will send  an invoice.  When licensing is complete the validity will be extended.

For countries using a national numbering scheme (e.g. Malta), this is where the Federation can issue a bib number to the athlete, which is then visible to everyone for the rest of the season.

#### 2.3.2 Entering Competitions

A major purpose of the system is to manage entries to competitions.   
You can see upcoming competitions which are open for entries on the front page of your web site.

The team manager selects athletes for each event by simply selecting the event and then clicking on the athletes name from a drop down list. Predictive text speeds the process up for large clubs. The system ensures that only those with the correct gender and age enter each event.
