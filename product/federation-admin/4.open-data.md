## __4__ Open Data

With OpenTrack, you always have full access to all of your data.   You will never feel like a prisoner or be asked to pay to access it.

We aim to make as much information public as possible, so that athletes, coaches and parents can quickly spot mistakes, and report or correct them; and so that volunteers can do exciting things with the data.

We recognize that you need to integrate with other systems, import and export freely.  So we make it as easy as possible to retrieve data in formats like JSON, Excel and PDF.  Competition Organisers have full access to data on their competitors, and Federation staff can access everything in their country.   

For developers we already have JSON URLs, APIs and Push Notifications - all the tools you need to integrate with us.  Just get in touch!
