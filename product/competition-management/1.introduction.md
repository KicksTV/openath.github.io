## __1__ Introduction
OpenTrackâ€™s Competition Management System (CMS) allows meeting organisers to deal with the complexities of a full scale track and field match.
It has been used to successfully manage various events ranging from international athletics championships through to local open meetings.

Due to the various requirements of different organisers and the complexities of track and field, we are continually updating and improving the system to progress its capabilities and improve user experience.

Key benefits:
* Volunteers and organisers spend less of their time entering data
* Athletes and spectators can view their results quickly and in a convenient format
* Entry payments are handled automatically and all in one place

The CMS is a combination of our <a href="/product/results-capture.html">Results Capture</a>, <a href="/product/entries-system.html">Entry System</a> and much more.
