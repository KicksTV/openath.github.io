## __1__ Introduction
OpenTrack's Competition Management System (CMS) allows meeting organisers to deal with the complexities of a full scale track and field match. It goes beyond simple <a href="https://opentrack.run/product/results-capture.html">results capture</a> as it allows the complete management of the match. Volunteers spend less of their time entering data and athletes and spectators can view their results quickly and in a convenient format. 


The CMS has been operational since 2018, and in this time has successfully managed various events ranging from international athletics championships through to local open meetings. Due to the various requirements of different organisers and the complexities of track and field, it is constantly being updated and improved to help progress the system and improve user experience.
