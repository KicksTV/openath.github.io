## __2__ CMS Features in OpenTrack 


<div markdown="1" data-aos="fade-up">

### 2.1 Entries

#### Payments management + customisable pricing
OpenTrack takes care of all the entry payments for you.<br>
You can customise the pricing per event or per club, as well as adding in the option for charity donations or additional purchase such as event t-shirts.

#### Bulk/team entries
Team managers can make use of the team entry feature and enter many athletes at once across several events with one easy group payment.

#### Entry restrictions
Entry restrictions can be automatically applied such as the need for a national federation licence, or restricting the entries to only from certain clubs/athletes.<br>
The athlete entry journey can also be customised to include requests for PB/SB performances for seeding and agreements to your competition's covid restrictions.

<i>Alge, FinishLynx, Seiko, Swiss Timing, MacFinish / Timetronics, RaceResults, RaceTec</i>

Don’t see your system here? Let us know and we’ll work on implementing it.

#### Team and combined events scoring
You name it - we’ve coded it! With more than 40 preconfigured team scoring methods and combined events scoring tables readily available in our database, as well as the ability to implement your own custom points scoring formulae, we’ve got you covered.
