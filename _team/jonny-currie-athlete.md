I was an 800m runner through my late teens and early 20s, most notably winning the Scottish Junior Championships in 2015, and being ranked in the top 25 juniors in the UK with a personal best of 1:52 aged 19.

Having been ranked highly in all events from 400m up to half marathon, I later turned my hand to multi-events for a new challenge. I finished 23rd at the World Ultra-Multi-Events championships in France in 2021.

Noteworthy head-to-head victories during my junior career include: Neil Gourley (World 1500m finalist), Chris McAlister (World 400mH semi-finalist), and Charlie Myers (British pole vault champion 2019).
