Andy Robinson has been developing software since the age of 16, and professionally for the last 25 years. 

His career started with a degree in Physics and Philosophy from Oxford, followed by stints in advertising, investment banking and small business, before settling on his teenage passion of programming.

In 1998 Andy wrote the original version of the Reportlab library, one of the world’s most popular open source tools for generating PDF documents and reports, and launched ReportLab in 2000.   Since that time, he has led a small team delivering over a hundred projects, delivering large scale solutions to clients in fund management, travel, banking and many other industries, and ensuring they are well supported for the lifetime of the solution., as well as extending the company’s key reporting products.

He has been heavily involved in the Open Source software world, being a co-author of one of the first books on the Python language, and a lecturer/trainer at Open Source conferences in the USA.
