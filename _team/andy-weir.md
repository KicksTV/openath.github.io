Andy Weir worked in the Finance Industry for 24 years before deciding to find something more interesting to do in the Summer of 2016. Starting at JPMorgan, after researching into the Mathematics of Semiconductors at Oxford, he worked as a mathematician and quantitative analyst modelling large volumes of live data and forecasting the fixed income markets. 

After 5 years he moved to Fidelity Investments to lead the Fixed Income Research Team and work on risk modelling and data visualisation. As the models developed track records he started running client money. Over the next 15 years he attracted and was lead manager of more than $6bn of institutional and retail assets. He also spent a few years as Group Leader of Bonds, being in charge of all the fixed income fund managers and the total assets of $40bn.
