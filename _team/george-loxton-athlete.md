I started running at parkrun in 2014, becoming a regular runner and volunteer over the following 4 years.
Having taken part in a handful of road races, I came to university wanting to dedicate more time to running and train with a group for the first time. Finding myself among one of the best athletics setups in the country, I started competing more frequently over cross country and on the road and track.

Whilst competing to a high standard, I began supporting events in the summer of 2019, completing a timekeeper's course to support the university open meets, before being appointed Competition Director for the club in late 2019.
