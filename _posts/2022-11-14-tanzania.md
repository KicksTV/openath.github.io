OpenTrack is now in use on a new continent, after being used for the [Northern Tanzania Schools Athletics Association Secondary School Championships](https://data.opentrack.run/en-gb/x/2022/TZA/ntsaa-champs-secondary/).

Six schools took to the grass track at UWC East Africa, in the regional capital of Arusha, as over 200 athletes battled for Northern Tanzania Schools titles.

In use were OpenTrack’s versatile results and scoring systems, which saw [Orkeeswa School run out as winners](https://data.opentrack.run/en-gb/x/2022/TZA/ntsaa-champs-secondary/scores/), as well as our ever-growing suite of team management features.

>Introducing OpenTrack was a game changer, and it didn’t just help with entries, but also in getting minute-by-minute results updates.

**Brian Macmbinji**, *NTSAA Chairman*

Our bulk add feature allows team managers to import 100 athletes just as easily as they would one, making managing teams a breeze.

Last minute swaps are no trouble either, with teams changed in a matter of seconds, ready for whatever start line drama athletics has in store for you.

>Using OpenTrack today … just [allowed] us to focus on the coaching, and working with the children, everything else is working smoothly in the background.

**Jamel Badaoui**, *Head of Primary, St. Constantine's International School*
