We have now opened entries for two county cross country championships. We wish the athletes from Surrey and Buckinghamshire 
the very best of luck.
They will be the first to use our refined entry process. Now, if you have previously entered using our system,
the screens quickly allow you to check your details, including EA number, choose your event and pay.
