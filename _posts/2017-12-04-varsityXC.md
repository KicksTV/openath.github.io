Thames Hare and Hounds hosted the annual Varsity Match on Wimbledon Common. Nothing new in that, but this year we had splits from round 
the course relayed back to the club house. They and the finish line results were recorded using OpenTrack mobile phone technology.

The Thames course is a single lapper so unless you have a reasonable turn of speed spectating involves waiting for the athletes
to come back 40 minutes after the gun goes off. Using our mobile phone system we could track the pulsating men's race as the lead switched from Cambridge to Oxford. The ladies race was more one sided but the individual leaders could be followed.  Despite a few teething problems, the test was a success and the results and splits are on our [website](https://data.opentrack.run/x/2017/GBR/varsityxc/event/). We will be using the system again for the alumni race in a fortnight.
