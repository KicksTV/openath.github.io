With the days shortening and the cold & rain setting in, this long Indian summer is presumably now finally behind us. For many of us, longer runs and extended reps are now the order of the day, which must mean one thing - X-Country season is upon us; namely the unparalleled Surrey League!

Last Saturday it all kicked off with eight races taking place across the various leagues, genders and age groups.

The day was an outstanding success with great performances put in across all races, with first time winners in division one for both the men (Phil Seseman - Kent) and women (Saron Haileselase - Belgrave).

With the men's league taking the decision to adopt the women's declaration system, all bib allocations were completed well in advance and should now be sorted for the season, with the exception of incoming athletes. This should save time for all involved, making everyone's lives easier!

Importantly, <a href="https://surreyleague.org">results</a> were displayed very quickly after the race and all queries were dealt with swiftly and efficiently, enabling the results crossover to Power of 10 to be done in good time. In fact, six of the eight races used OpenTrack's timing system meaning there was no need for copying data between systems!

With the next race in just under a month's time, there is a lot to be done to prepare but we are all looking forward to it and can't wait to be racing again!!!
