Following the success of our inaugural data conference last year we were on the organising committee of Athtech 2017. Working with our friends from European Athletics, the W3C and the Algarve Athletics Federation we devised a 3 day <a href="https://athtech.run/">  agenda </a> covering a variety of topics from data standards to results visualisation.

Whether it was the agenda or the location near Faro, with 25 Deg C temperatures and blue skies, we do not know; but we doubled last years turn out. Despite Monarch Airlines going bust the day before, 35 delgates including 13 athletics federations met, worked together and discussed some of the big problems in athletics technology. OpenTrack, in the guise of Andy Robinson presented our <a href="https://estonia.opentrack.run/" > Federation Management </a>, competition management and data capture work.

GDPR Session

Other fascinating sessions included a presentation on GDPR (see photo) and a chance to try out athletics technology in practice on the local track. We have received good feedback on all the sessions from the morning run onwards and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B1SQhmuh1fT4U3lGWGZsb1NGaXM/view"> detailed minutes</a> have been written. We are looking forward to Athech 2018, possibly in Northern Spain in the Autumn.
