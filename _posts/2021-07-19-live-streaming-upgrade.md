Being drafted


With the number of spectators allowed on site for the UoB Track & Field Series being heavily restricted due to COVID-19 restrictions, we were keen to provide a livestream as a way of both allowing family and friends to watch athletes compete and to attract interest and investment for the meets.
Over the course of the four events, the livestreams have attracted more than 27,000 cumulative viewers, with more than 8,000 watching the April and May meets when restrictions were at their strictest. We were able to appeal to a new audience, and the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive with other clubs around the country asking how we were able to successfully stream the events.

The OpenTrack TV console provided the perfect way to present start lists and live results to our audience, and especially for our field events where we could provide round by round updates. The newest feature showing field results as they happened worked brilliantly, allowing the audience to engage with competitions that weren't necessarily being shown on screen at the time.

Having a popular livestream, with clear and informative graphics, enabled us to increase the publicity for the series, especially for the lead entries in our blue riband event at each meet. We have even bigger and better things planned for the coming year, with the livestream playing an integral role in showcasing our events.
