The Future of Athletics - Where is it heading? Just before we start, no - we are not opening a discussion on the fear of the potential introduction of genetically or mechanically modified athletes beginning to have an impact on our sport!

Currently, OpenTrack are looking much closer to home and are simply aiming to modernise the amateur world of the sport we all love. Specifically, moving away from an over-reliance on pen & paper and digitising our competitions. "Why?" We hear you ask. Importantly, this goes hand-in-hand with minimising officials & volunteers' workloads, potentially reducing costs, definitely imrpoving the eco foot-print, all whilst providing a more engaging, interactive experience for spectators & athletes. Sounds good, right?

## So, how can we help you?

In a nutshell, the Competition Management System is web based software designed to take all the pen, paper, time & stress out of the organistion and running of athletics competitions. It provides an individual and completely tailored microsite for your competition, meaning you can organise it exactly as you want, from detailed information through to logo display.

Fans and spectators love it . . . 
	 . . . it provides live, real-time results and scores straight to their mobile device. 

## _3 Race Timing_

Athletics participation increasing can only be a good thing, however it does come with a potential escalation of costs. Many events nowadays use chip timing for even simple races, such as XC. OpenTrack have a straightforward and manageable race timing software that you can use for free. Designed to work on phone and tablets this is great for keeping costs down whilst maintaining the detail and accuracy required. 

## Current Users

OpenTrack is currently used all across the UK for various competitions, ranging from XC leagues and county championships through to national events. 

Importantly, Welsh Athletics use it exclusively for all their major championships, whilst countries such as Norway, Estonia, Malta & Cyprus use it to manage their entire athletic database and competitions.
