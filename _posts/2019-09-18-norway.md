We are pleased to anounce that Norway have signed on to adopt the OpenTrack platform for all their Federation & Competition Management requirement, before the end of 2019   

_"We are looking forward to cooperating with OpenTrack, and to start working on developing a comprehensive event management tool. This is highly needed for Norwegian Athletics and will help us serve our member clubs and athletes even better" - Kjetil Hildeskor, General Secretary, Norwegian Athletics_


The solution will include many new features we are developing for next season, and will roll out to our other federation customers: 
- athletes able to buy licenses at the point of race entry
- team entries with payment options
- a completely new individual entry journey
- features to manage road races better
- a new look and feel

The solution will progressively be made available to every club and competition in Norway at no extra cost.
