Within the Competition Management System, OpenTrack has <a href="/product/results-capture.html">Results Capture</a>. This system is used to display the results of athletics competition both quickly and in a logical, well presented format. There are a number of different results screens, which can be seen below. 

### 4.1 Race Results - Standard

These can be displayed in either a simple and standard format or using the graphical tool, which plays a split-by-split narrative of a race.

In addition to the overall results, splits were taken every 200m for races at Night of the 10,000m so detailed analysis of the race, such as pace consistency and sprint finishes, can easily be viewed.

For many athletics meets there is a team aspect, alongside individual competitions. The OpenTrack system can be configured to display team scores after the event and also as the competition unfolds.

### 4.2 Race Results - Graphical

The graphical display of results works best with events where splits are taken on multiple occasions, usually in track meets. This gives the opportunity to show the positions of athletes as the race unfolds.

### 4.3 Field Events - Standard

Similar to the race results, field events can be displayed in multiple formats.

### 4.4 Field Events - Graphical

As with race results, the graphical version of field events is a user-friendly format. It is especially useful when the event is in progress to keep up to date with proceedings. Spectators on the opposite side of the stadium can keep in touch with the competition.
