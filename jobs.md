# Part time work at OpenTrack 

If you love athletics, and would like to contribute, we're looking for capable part time workers in a number of fields.    You should be available for at least one season - until the end of summer 2023 - for a few hours a week.  There may also be specific projects which are more intense during holidays or agreed times.

To date we've had great success working with students in University athletics clubs in the UK, as they use our system for their own meetings.  However, we are in no way limited to this.

If you're looking for experience in the software business, check the technical roles below.  OpenTrack's sister company, ReportLab, is perhaps the oldest Python shop in the UK, and has been developing and managing solutions in the Python language for 23 years. We can offer a breadth of experience you aren't likely to get anyhere else, as well as mentoring by developers with decades of experience - all combined with your true love, Athletics!


## Operational Support

You'll learn our system and
 - respond to support emails at agreed times of the week, 
 - help our users to set up competitions. 
 - potentially travel to competitions to train users, or handle results and scoring for them
 - continually review
 - help reproduce, log and test bugs
 - test, give feedback on, and help to design new features
 - improve the documentation


## Social Media and Marketing

We need social-media-savvy people to get some news out on a regular basis, both on our site and in linked posts on Facebook and Twitter.  You'll be able to do some short punchy writing and create the right imagery (we're starting to use Figma).



## Trainee Back End Developer 

You should know  Python as the minimum.

Our application is written in Python and Django, using Amazon's flavours of MySQL and MongoDB on the back end.  On the front end, we use VueJS when we need to go beyond vanilla Javascript.



## Cloud Support and system administration

You'll help us to manage the web platforms we depend on - Amazon Web Services and several others, do checks on a regular basis, and help investigate issues.  You'll also dial up the capacity when competitions are starting, and turn off servers afterwards, and keep an eye on things in busy periods.


## Data Management

We have a ton of data, with over 100,000 users and a growing number of countries.  We need someone to keep an eye on duplicate and incorrect data and generally ensure data quality.  You'll either know, or need to learn SQL, and work with the developers to build the right dashboards.  You will supervise regular processes importing data from federations we work with.

From time to time (especially when a customer does something wrong!) there will be data correction tasks to do through our admin developers, or we'll ask you to help new organisations get set up quickly.
