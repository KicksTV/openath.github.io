# Part time work at OpenTrack 

If you love athletics, and would like to contribute, we're looking for capable part time workers in a number of fields.    You should be available for at least one athletics season - until the end of summer 2023 - for a few hours a week.  There may also be specific projects which are more intense during holidays or agreed times.

To date we've had great success working with students in several University athletics clubs in the UK, as they use our system already for their own meetings.  However, we are in no way limited to this.

If you're looking for a future career in the software business, check the technical roles below.  OpenTrack's progenitor and sister company, [ReportLab](https://www.reportlab.com/), is perhaps the oldest Python shop in the UK, and has been developing and managing solutions in the Python language for 23 years. Both companies share the same tools and can "borrow" each other's staff if needed, so you might end up working for financial customers too, especially if you're a software developer!

We can offer a breadth of experience you aren't likely to get anyhere else, as well as mentoring by developers with decades of experience - all combined with your true love, Athletics!

## How to apply

In all cases, send an email to [info@opentrack.run](mailto:info@opentrack.run), making clear which of the areas below you think you are suited to, and detailing relevant experience, and how long you will be available for. A CV is welcome too if you have one.


## Operational Support

You'll learn our system and...
 - respond to support emails at agreed times of the week, 
 - help our users to set up competitions. 
 - potentially travel to competitions to train users, or handle results and scoring for them
 - continually review and elp to design new features
 - help reproduce, log and test bugs
 - test, give feedback on, and help design new features


## Social Media and Marketing

We need social-media-savvy people to get some news out on a regular basis, both on our site and in linked posts on Facebook and Twitter.  You'll be able to do some short punchy writing and create the right imagery (we're starting to use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)).

If you're good at creating graphics (or get good at it too) you can help out the development cycle by prototyping design changes, and creating diagrams and assets for presentations.


## Trainee Developers 

You should know some Python as the minimum.  Depending on your experience, we might start you off with writing automated tests, or performance optimisations, or simpler parts of the code.  After a year, you'll typically end up understanding the complete web development stack for a large application, and the complete software development cycle, and be able to point at features the world is using, and say "I did that!".  

Our application is written in Python and Django, using Amazon's flavours of MySQL and MongoDB on the back end.  On the front end, we use VueJS when we need to go beyond vanilla Javascript. 

Front end skills, and the ability to make HTML and CSS look tidy and do what you want, would be highly valuable.  If you've designed anything you are proud of, send us links.



## Cloud Support and system administration

You'll help us to manage the web platforms we depend on - Amazon Web Services and several others, do checks on a regular basis, and help investigate issues.  You'll also dial up the capacity when competitions are starting, and turn off servers afterwards, and keep an eye on things in busy periods.


## Data Management

We have a ton of data, with over 100,000 users and a growing number of countries.  We need someone to keep an eye on duplicate and incorrect data and generally ensure data quality.  You'll either know, or need to learn SQL, and work with the developers to build the right dashboards.  You will supervise regular processes importing data from federations we work with.

From time to time (especially when a customer does something wrong!) there will be data correction tasks to do through our admin developers, or we'll ask you to help new organisations get set up quickly.
